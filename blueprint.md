# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the structure, design, and features of the Flutter application. It serves as a single source of truth for the project's development.

## Style, Design, and Features

- **Home Screen:** The application now has a valid home screen, `NovedadBolsoScreen`, which resolves the "too many redirects" error.
- **Theme:** A basic dark theme has been implemented using `ThemeData` with a custom color scheme and `google_fonts` for typography.
- **UI:** The `NovedadBolsoScreen` displays a background image, a dark overlay, and a welcome message.

## Current Task: Implement UI Enhancements

**Plan:**
1.  Add a prominent call-to-action button to the center of the `NovedadBolsoScreen`.
2.  Create a new screen, `CatalogoScreen`, to display a catalog of products.
3.  Implement navigation from the `NovedadBolsoScreen` to the `CatalogoScreen` when the new button is pressed.
